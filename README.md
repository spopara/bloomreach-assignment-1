# Bloomreach Assignment 1

## The Task

Create a simple website using HTML5, plain CSS3 and (optionally) plain JavaScript.
Do not use any libraries (no SASS, no Bootstrap, no jQuery, no Angular, no React etc.).
The site should work in your favorite browser.

- **Part 1: Create a menu**
  Show a menu with a number of menu items with different names.
  The page itself shows Lorem Ipsum text. Each menu item has three sub-items.
- **Part 2: Behavior of submenu**
  Clicking a sub-item shows an alert with the name of the clicked submenu item.
- **Part 3: DOM mutation**
  Clicking a top-level menu item expands the sub-menu. Clicking it again collapses the sub-menu.
- **Part 4: Create a sticky footer**
  Add a sticky footer to the bottom of the page. When the page content does not fill the full
  viewport height, the footer should still be located at the bottom of the page. When the page
  content becomes longer the footer is 'pushed down' so a user has to scroll down to see it.
- **Bonus Points: Animation**
  Animate the expansion/collapse of sub-menus.

## The Solution

To run the project clone it and open the __index.html__ in __Chrome__ browser. To test the sticky footer,
resize the browser window and check the footer behaviour.
